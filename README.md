# SlackTimer
A custom integration feature of slack. It allows users to send timed messages to their teammates. 
Usage syntax:
/timer [recipient] [time_in_minutes] [message_text]

For example, /timer tim 50 Ping me when meeting gets over.

Currently,this app supports timed direct IMs but I have planned to add support for timed messages into channels soon.
