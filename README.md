# SlackTimer
A custom integration feature of slack. It allows users to send timed messages to their teammates. <br/>
Usage syntax: /timer [recipient] [time_in_minutes] [message_text] <br/>

For example, /timer tim 50 Ping me when meeting gets over. <br/>

Currently,this app supports only timed direct IMs. I have planned to add support for timed messages into group channels soon.<br/>
